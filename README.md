# temperature-optima

This repository contains two scripts used in the analysis:

1. fitOptima.m

A MATLAB function that fits a quadratic curve to temperature and GPP data to estimate the crop-specific optimal temperature (Topt) and related metrics.


2. compute_topt_exceedance.py

A Python script that calculates the first year when growing season mean temperature exceeds Topt under future climate scenarios, producing spatial raster outputs.
